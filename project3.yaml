clause_control_test:
  promises:
    - clause: "The fraud scoring API maintains 99.9% monthly uptime. Under load or partial failure, the platform first suspends non-critical premium alert fanout while keeping core fraud scoring available for all merchants."
      control: "DNS failover records, multi-AZ deployment for the scoring service, per-tenant rate limiting, and latency-based routing between healthy instances."
      test: "tests/redbar/test_uptime_reliability.py::test_graceful_degradation_order"
      enforcement_point: "DNS routing configuration and health-checked scoring endpoints"

    - clause: "Canadian fraud telemetry remains in ca-central-1 and Indian telemetry remains in ap-south-1; PAN and CVV are never written to any log, and raw fraud logs are deleted within 30 days with only anonymized aggregates retained up to one year."
      control: "Region-locked DNS resolvers, region-scoped S3/log buckets, ingestion schema validation for PAN/CVV, and S3 lifecycle rules for 30-day deletion and 1-year aggregates."
      test: "tests/redbar/test_data_residency_privacy.py::test_raw_fraud_logs_deleted_within_30_days"
      enforcement_point: "Log bucket configuration, ingestion schema checks, DNS firewall rules, and lifecycle policies"

    - clause: "Premium alerts may speed up delivery and improve dashboard freshness, but they must not weaken privacy, data-retention, or fairness protections compared to the standard tier; the fraud model, telemetry fields, and retention windows remain the same for all merchants."
      control: "Monetization feature flags, shared ingestion schema and storage pipelines for standard and premium tiers, and identical S3 lifecycle rules across tiers."
      test: "tests/redbar/test_monetization_guardrail.py::test_retention_windows_identical"
      enforcement_point: "Premium feature flag configuration, alert queue routing rules, and policy files (terms_of_service.md, privacy_addendum.md, log_retention_policy.md)"

      acceptance_test: "tests/redbar/test_monetization_guardrail.py::test_premium_overload_does_not_push_standard_behind_baseline"
  viability_statement: "Premium alerts are viable if enough merchants value faster delivery while the platform preserves identical privacy, residency, and fairness guarantees, including maintaining standard tier baseline delivery windows during overload."
